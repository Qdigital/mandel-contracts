# Mandel Contracts

## Repo organization

Current development is on the `main` branch. There aren't any releases yet; they'll eventually be on release branches.

## Supported Operating Systems

To speed up development, we're starting with **Ubuntu 20.04**. We'll support additional operating systems as time and personnel allow. In the mean time, they may break.

## Building

To speed up development and reduce support overhead, we're initially only supporting the following build approach. CMake options not listed here may break. Build scripts may break. Dockerfiles may break.

### Ubuntu 20.04 dependencies

```
apt-get update && apt-get install   \
        binaryen                    \

# Install CDT v1.7.0
#
curl -LO https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/releases/download/v1.7.0/eosio.cdt_1.7.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb
dpkg -i eosio.cdt_1.7.0-1-ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb

#
# Build Mandel from sources. Not needed if you use
# -DBUILD_TESTS=no
#
mkdir -p ~/work
cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel.git
cd mandel
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDISABLE_WASM_SPEC_TESTS=yes ..
make -j $(nproc)
```

### Building

```
# Where you built Mandel
export PATH=~/work/mandel/build/bin:$PATH

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=yes ..
make -j $(nproc)
```

We support the following CMake options:
```
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG      Debug builds
-DBUILD_TESTS=no              Don't build the tests; it
                              builds much faster without them
```

### Running tests

```
cd build/tests
ctest -j $(nproc)
```
